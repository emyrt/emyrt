		<figcaption>Corn (Zea mays), also known as maize, is a tall, annual cereal grass cultivated for its large, elongated ears containing starchy seeds. These seeds, or kernels, are used for various purposes, including human food, animal feed, and biofuel production. Corn is a monoecious plant, meaning it has separate male (tassel) and female (ear) flowers on the same plant. The female flowers are covered by protective leaves called husks, and the kernels are the edible part of the plant once fertilized. </figcaption>
